# Readme

These two programs are used for parsing weather information and books. **Free APIs are used for this**. The pandas and pprint library is used for good information output. The information extracted from the api is:
1. Information about the weather in any city in the world
2. Information about any books by keywords from the title

Libraries: `pprint`, `pandas`, `requests`, `json`
